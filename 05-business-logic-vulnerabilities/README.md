# Business logic vulnerabilities

From PortSwigger Web Security Academy:
> "Business logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that allow an attacker to elicit unintended behavior"

# Labs 
Example of business logic vulnerabilities with hands-on labs (apprentice only):

### Excessive trust in client-side controls
All labs: [Excessive trust in client-side controls](02-failing-to-handle-unconventional-input/README.md)
- [x] Excessive trust in client-side controls
- [x] 2FA broken logic

### Failing to handle unconventional input
All labs: [Failing to handle unconventional input](02-failing-to-handle-unconventional-input/README.md)
- [x] High-level logic vulnerability

### Making flawed assumptions about user behavior
All labs: [Making flawed assumptions about user behavior](03-flawed-assumptions-about-user-behaviour/README.md)
- [x] Inconsistent security controls
- [x] Password reset broken logic
- [x] 2FA simple bypass
