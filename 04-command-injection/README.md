Command injection is a vulnerability that allows attackers to execute arbitrary operating system command.


## Impact

- Sensitive data
- System take over/full compromise of the hosting infrastructure


# Labs

Example of command injection with hands-on labs:
### Executing arbitrary commands
All labs: [Executing arbitrary commands](01-executing-arbitrary-commands)
- [x] OS command injection, simple case

### Blind OS command injection
All labs: [Blind OS command injection](02-blind-os-command-injection)
- [x] Blind OS command injection with time delays
- [x] Blind OS command injection with output redirection
- [x] Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction
